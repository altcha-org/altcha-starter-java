# ALTCHA Server Demo for Java

This repository demonstrates the implementation of an ALTCHA server with spam filtering using the Java version of the [altcha-lib-java](https://github.com/altcha-org/altcha-lib-java) library. The server provides endpoints for fetching challenges and submitting form data, including verification of Proof-of-Work (PoW) solutions and spam filtering.

## Documentation

- [Server Integration](https://altcha.org/docs/server-integration/)
- [Spam Filter Payload Verification](https://altcha.org/docs/api/challenge-api/#server-verification)

## Requirements

- Java (JDK 11 or later)
- Maven (v3.6 or later)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/altcha-org/altcha-starter-java.git
    cd altcha-starter-java
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    mvn clean install
    ```

## Configuration

The server requires the following environment variables for configuration:

- `ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY`: Secret key used for HMAC in ALTCHA challenge generation (optional, generated if not provided).

You can create a `.env` file in the root directory to set these environment variables:

```ini
PORT=3000
ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY=your_custom_hmac_key
```

Alternatively, you can set environment variables directly in your system or IDE.

## Modes of Operation

- **Self-Hosted**: In fully self-hosted mode, configure your `ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY` (a secure randomly generated key) and utilize the `GET /altcha` as the `challengeurl` and the `POST /submit` endpoint as the form's `action`.
- **ALTCHA API without Spam Filter**: Configure ALTCHA's API URL as `challengeurl` and the `POST /submit` endpoint as the form's `action`. Configure your API Key's secret as `ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY` (e.g., `ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY=csec_...`).
- **ALTCHA API with Spam Filter**: Configure ALTCHA's API URL as `challengeurl` and the `POST /submit_spam_filter` endpoint as the form's `action`. Configure your API Key's secret as `ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY` (e.g., `ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY=csec_...`).

## Verification Methods

- **`verifySolution`**: Used when verifying a simple Proof-of-Work (PoW) challenge. This is the standard verification method when the **Spam Filter is NOT enabled** on the ALTCHA widget.

- **`verifyServerSignature`**: Used when the **Spam Filter is enabled** on the ALTCHA widget. When the Spam Filter is active, the format of the ALTCHA payload changes, and additional verification steps are required to ensure the submission is not spam.

## Usage

To start the server, run:

```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The server will be running on the port specified in the configuration (default is 3000).

## Endpoints

### GET /altcha

Fetches a new random challenge to be used by the ALTCHA widget.

- **URL:** `/altcha`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Response:** JSON object containing the challenge.

#### Example

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/altcha
```

### POST /submit

Submits form data and verifies the simple PoW challenge without the spam filter.

- **URL:** `/submit`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Request Body:** JSON object containing form data with the `altcha` field.

#### Example

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"altcha":"your_verification_payload"}' http://localhost:3000/submit
```

### POST /submit_spam_filter

Submits form data and verifies the server signature generated by the spam filter.

- **URL:** `/submit_spam_filter`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Request Body:** JSON object containing form data with the `altcha` field.

#### Example

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"altcha":"your_verification_payload"}' http://localhost:3000/submit_spam_filter
```
